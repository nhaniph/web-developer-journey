 **Thoughts** : The first issue wasn't much of a problem. Fixed the anchor tags, added syntax highlighting to the codeblocks in .md files. As for the second one, It was quite rought. First, had to face the struggle to setup the repo locally, then getting email to work. Then, working on the password logic. It was lots of reading too. Min. 50 tabs had been opened at one time. In the end, happy to made the pull request. Hope it gets merged. Nothing is more sweeter than success after doing hard work.

 **Thoughts** : Would pass on the FCC issue. It too much of out of my limits. Hopefully will learn Node, Mongo soon. Then contribute on issues like this. Althought, I haven't been succed, It has been great learning experience on this issue. Learned to setup a project locally and one as big as FCC. Also, saw the codebase that runs the FCC. Will be helpful in working on issues later.

**Link to work** : [Portfolio Project](https://shovanch.com/portfolio-two/)

**Thoughts** : Its looking good enough. Experimented with colors with this project. Stayed with gray as primary color and shades  of it. Used single font family to simplify the design process. Overall its a good experience. One thing need to work on, making the coding habit at a consistent time early in the day, rather than till the late night. So far, so good. Will write a medium article on monday about journey so far of first 20 days.

**Thoughts** : Horrible week this has been. Lots of missed. Probably the problem is I'm focusing too much on the project. THe optimal approach would be to just focus on sit and code for 1 hour daily. That's it. Its the better way.

------------

 ### July 6 : Missed.

### Day 14 : June 28, Wednesday
**Todays's Progress** : Made the boilerplate for projects. It would make starting projects very easy. As it would bypass stage  of starting from scratch and setting  everything - "A recipe of procrastination"

**Thoughts** : Had been using a boilerplate for projects. But that was for only HTML, CSS. This time added gulp tasks for SASS, BrowserSync, Autoprefix, Sourcemaps. Been using Livestyle for LiveReloading CSS, but with SASS, that wasn't working so, added BrowserSync. There had been some hiccup while setting up. Looked up on web , at the end done it. Its time to work on projects.

------------

 ### Day 11 : June 25: Sunday
**Todays's Progress** : :metal: Completed the SASS course at treehouse. Lots of things to understand. Will practice by implementing them for better understanding.

**Thing(s) learned**:
* Using partials for modular code
* Making custom functions and color functions
* Using mixin with null and keyword arguments - useful for flexbox syntaxes

**Thing(s) learned**:
* Variables in Sass
* Nested selector and ampersand for parent reference.
